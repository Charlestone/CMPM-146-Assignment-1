We have slightly modified the function show_level from the p1_support.py file so the user can choose between printing in command line or in a file. We know we have not been asked for this, but we believe that you should be able to see the whole cycle. For this propose, we have also added all the files needed for the expected execution. If you execute the file p1.py with our p1_support.py, you should get everything you have asked us to do.
